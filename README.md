Project Title:
California Housing Price Prediction – Kaggle Dataset

Description:
This project presents a streamlined end-to-end workflow for predicting California housing prices using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. It includes thorough data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the application of machine learning techniques.

Key steps in the project:

Loading and cleaning the California housing dataset, handling missing values and categorical variables.

Exploratory analysis with pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for feature distributions and relationships.

Feature engineering, including transformation of skewed data (e.g., log transforms), and creation of domain features like "bedroom ratio" and "household rooms".

Building regression models (e.g., Linear Regression using Scikit-learn) to predict median house values.

Evaluation of model performance using the R² score on the test set.

Visualizations such as feature histograms and scatter plots to support the analysis.

Dataset:
