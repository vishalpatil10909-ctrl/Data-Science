### 1. Open VS Code:

Open Visual Studio Code and open a new or existing project.

### 2. Open the integrated terminal:

Press `Ctrl + ` (backtick) to open the integrated terminal in VS Code.

### 3. Navigate to your project directory:

Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. You can use the `cd` command to change directories. For example:

```bash
cd path/to/your/project
```

### 4. Create a virtual environment:

Use the following command to create a virtual environment:

#### On Windows:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

#### On macOS/Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

### 5. Activate the virtual environment:

#### On Windows:

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\Activate
```

#### On macOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 6. Install Flask:

While the virtual environment is active, install Flask using:

```bash
pip install Flask
```

### 7. Create a Flask app:

Create a new file, for example, `app.py`, in the VS Code editor and add the Flask application code mentioned in the previous response.

### 8. Run the Flask app:

In the VS Code terminal, make sure your virtual environment is still activated, and run:

```bash
python app.py
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser, and you should see "Hello, World!".

Using the VS Code terminal is convenient because you can manage your virtual environment, install packages, and run your code all within the same environment.
